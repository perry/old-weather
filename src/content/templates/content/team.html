<h1>The Old Weather Team</h1>

<p><strong>Rob Allan</strong> is based at the Met Office Hadley Centre where he leads the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions of the Earth (ACRE) initiative (<a href="http://www.met-acre.org" target="_blank">http://www.met-acre.org</a>). Old Weather is a part of the international outreach arm of ACRE.</p>
<p><strong>Philip Brohan</strong> is a climate scientist at the Met Office Hadley Centre, where he tries to combine information from old documents, tree-rings and large computers, into a clear picture of what the weather used to be like.</p>
<p><strong>Lucinda Donnachie</strong> is a Digital Project Manager at the National Maritime Museum. She manages the Museum's collections website as well as crowdsourcing projects.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Lintott</strong> is an astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, although he can normally be found at the University of Oxford. Having encouraged hundreds of thousands of people to classify galaxies with <a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org" target="_blank">Galaxy Zoo</a>, he leads the <a href="http://www.zooniverse.org" target="_blank">Zooniverse</a> team. He's also partial to a really nice glass of Riesling.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Lynn</strong> is an astronomer and the main Zooniverse developer for Old Weather.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Mollan</strong> is an archivist in the Navy/Maritime section of the U.S. National Archives and coordinates Old Weather project activities at the Archives.</p>
<p><strong>Arfon Smith</strong> is an astronomer turned software developer based at the University of Oxford. In his role as Tech lead of all things <a href="http://www.zooniverse.org" target="_blank">Zooniverse</a> he manages the software team that built this thing.</p>
<p><strong>Gordon Smith</strong>, a one-time engineer, military operations analyst and human relations manager, lost his father in action at sea in 1943. Wanting to discover more, he wrote a couple of naval history books in his 40's and then started <a href="http://naval-history.net" target="_blank">Naval-History.net</a> to help others do the same. Long-retired, he loves sailing.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Wood</strong>, U.S. Old Weather - Arctic lead investigator, is a climate scientist at the NOAA â€“ University of Washington Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Compo</strong> is a climate scientist leading the 20th Century Reanalysis <a href="http://go.usa.gov/XTd">Project</a> at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences of the University of Colorado at Boulder and is an affiliate of the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory. He has a blast using supercomputers to reconstruct the weather from the surface of the earth to the level of the jet stream as far back as Old Weather can go. He also likes a good stout.</p>
<p><strong>Clive Wilkinson</strong> is research manager for the Recovery of Logbooks and International Marine Data (RECLAIM) Project <a href="http://icoads.noaa.gov/reclaim" target="_blank">http://icoads.noaa.gov/reclaim</a>, a part of NOAA's Climate Database Modernisation Program. He is based at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.</p>
